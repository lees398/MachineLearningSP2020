      "\"*Okay. This is a bit of nonsense. Not that I support Wikipediocracy, but I am almost sure that even if 28bytes would have said that he edited Wikipediocracy, and that he authored these blog posts, he would have been elected anyways. He has been an extremely trusted user of this website, and the mere fact that he authored these blog posts (that were actual constructive criticism, instead of outing, or similar) is not srtong enough for a resignation. So, I ask 28bytes to not resign as an arbitrator. As Kumioko said, \"\"notification of contributions in Wikipediocracy [is not] a requirement for ArbCom,\"\" and I don't feel betrayed by the fact that he did so. Was it relevant? Maybe. Was it relevant enough to be added to his candidacy statement? Hell, no. I'd feel betrayed if a couple of editor advocate for a position that he earned with 475 votes and 80.78% of support. — 21 Call me Hahc21 \n",

I am very new at wikipedia and I make mistakes and people like you are not very helpful and are extremely annoying by stalking me. Just leave me alone Gdo01, stop stalking me, stop talking to me (Unless I vandalize something), and just leave me alone. I did not know you could not have more than one account, big deal, I am only 16 and very new at wikipedia but I get it now, so will you just leave me alone? Please? It would be much appreciated.

This was not a 3RR, as info was added. When two editors with up to 3RR's each join up to edit-war, a solitary user is unfairly outnumbered. This can only be seen as manipulation against me as user, with the intent to maintain/introduce biased info on Wikipedia. I find this shameful, but have neither time nor editing-skills and -knowledge of Wikipedia-arcania to continue these efforts at defending Hamsun's reputation towards the English-speaking world, against such persistent efforts at negatively biasing the impression of Hamsun. The errors are winning. Why isn't reason supported better on Wikipedia? - As for \"\"admin attention\"\", I don't know what or who that is.

Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.\n",

      "Despite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said \"\"Lone Jogger\"\". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar \"\"robble robble.\"\" In \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,\"\" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald\"\"; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.\n",
      "Hamburglar 2015\n",
      "In 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   \"\n",
