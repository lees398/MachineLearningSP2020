Regarding the usual claims by advocate 202.63.42.221, sourcing must be the basis for the article. The claim that \"\"or to his devotees\"\" is POV fails to consider the source itself. The Adidam source clearly states that \"\"...\"\"Adi Da\"\" is the principal Name of Avatar Adi Da Samraj...\"\"; that devotees recognize him as the \"\"...Primordial Being, the Source of all, the Original Divine Person, Daand He is the Avatar, the bodily Revelation of that One...\"\"; that \"\"Samraj\"\" is a Title for Avatar Adi Da, which He was offered by His devotees in 1996. \"\"Samraj\"\" means the \"\"Universal Ruler\"\", or \"\"Supreme Lord\"\"...\"\".; To address Adi Da as \"\"Ruchira\"\" (Sanskrit for \"\"radiant\"\") is acknowledge Him as \"\"the Radiant, Shining, 'Bright' One\"\"...when Avatar Adi Da's devotees use it in reference to Him, they intend it in the sense of \"\"The One Who Is, Self-Radiant, Inherently (or Perfectly Subjectively) 'Bright', Self-Enlightened, and Eternally Awake\"\"...\"\". And \"\"...He took the Name of Adi Da Samraj. And more fully, in 1997: Adi Da Love-Ananda Samraj. This Nameoffered to Him by His devoteesdescribes His present Revelation. He is \"\"Adi\"\", the Source-Person, the First and Only Person, The Divine Person of Love-Bliss. He is \"\"Da Love-Ananda\"\", the Giver of Love-Bliss to all. And He is \"\"Samraj\"\"the Divine King, the Master of Reality, serving all by the Transmission of His Heart-Awakening Grace; andin their right relationship to Him (Dseer note: an Adidam euphemism for devotion) being served by all, so that all may fully receive that Transmission, and Realize the Divine....\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does this source clearly state the Adidam position that \"\"to address Adi Da as \"\"Ruchira\"\" (Sanskrit for \"\"radiant\"\") is acknowledge Him as \"\"the Radiant, Shining, 'Bright' One\"\", which those outside the group or not in sympathy with it (non-devotees) would not acknowledge, but a google search for \"\"Ruchira Avatar Adi Da Samraj\"\" confirms that what comes up in any signficant order, excluding this article itself, for that title, is either Adidam sites and material or that of devotees. There is no thus evidence to support your claim that non-devotees would routinely refer to him by anything other than \"\"Adi Da\"\" (his primary name per the source), his name during the controversial period (Da Free John), or his given name of Franklin Jones today, rather than \"\"the Ruichira Avatar Adi Da Samraj\"\" (meaning \"\"the radiant avatar, primordial giver, universal ruler\"\"), or as \"\"Beloved\"\" either, which as per the source, devotees would use. Thus, \"\"or to his devotees as...\"\" and defining what the titles and names mean to devotees, is perfectly appropriate and informative. \n",
      "\n",
      "The addition of all the names in the intro instead of just a few improves the article because Adi Da has been known by so many names, that it is important for the casual reader to know up front all these are the same person. The introduction isn't excessively long, it is only six sentences. One describes what him, one lists his many names, one sumarizes his dogma, one describes the highly publicized allegations, one lists the Adidam response, and one specifies these charges were settled out of court.

While my reputation is unblemished and everyone who has followed me here knows that I'm here to add my knowledge on Jewish subjects for which I have barely scratched the surface, and although I am bold,  I go out of my way to be fair and uphold the neutrality of Wikipedia. Tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a Palestinian POV. I'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. By equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. It seems to me that she cannot do any bad and I cannot do very much good; that's the impression I get from your comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some things you say which I find incorrect or disturbing. The reason I am calm is because I have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on Wikipedia. Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add \"\"nation\"\" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.\n",

Now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then Wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.   \n",

      "But the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now. From them split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Touga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land. After they had fought one another for some vears, the Croats prevailed and killed some of the Avars and the remainder they compelled to be subject to them. And so from that time this land was possessed by the Croats, and there are still in Croatia some who are of Avar descent and are recognized as Avars. The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, white Croats, and have their own prince ; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, or Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia a part split off and possessed themselves of Illyricum and Pannonia ; they too had a sovereign prince, who used to maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the prince of Croatia. For a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia also were subject to the Franks, as they had formerly been in their own country ; but the Franks treated them with such brutality that they used to murder Croat infants at the breast and cast them to the dogs. The Croats, unable to endure such treatment from the Franks, revolted from them, and slew those of them whom they had for princes. On this, a large army from Francia marched against them, and after they had fought one another for seven years, at last the Croats managed to prevail and destroyed all the Franks with their leader, who was called Kotzilis. From that time they remained independent and autonomous,....\n",

      "These baptized Croats will not fight foreign countries outside the borders of their own ; for they received a kind of oracular response and promise from the pope of Rome who in the time of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, sent priests and baptized them. For after their baptism the Croats made a covenant, confirmed with their own hands and by oaths sure and binding in the name of St. Peter the apostle, that never would they go upon a foreign country and make war on it, but rather would live at peace with all who were willing to do so ; and they received from the same pope of Rome a benediction to this effect, that if any of the pagans should come against the country of these same Croats and bring war upon it, then might the God of the Croats fight for the Croats and protect them, and Peter the disciple of Christ give them victories.\n",

      "Again, Symeon sent another army against prince Zacharias, under Kninos and Himnikos and Itzboklias, and together with them he sent also Tzeeslav. Then Zacharias took fright and fled to Croatia, and the Bulgarians sent a message to the 'zupans' that they should come to them and should receive Tzeeslav for their prince ; and, having tricked them by an oath and brought them out as far as the first village, they instantly bound them, and entered Serbia and took away with them the entire folk, both old and young, and carried them into Bulgaria, though a few escaped away and entered Croatia ; and the country was left deserted. Now, at that time these same Bulgarians under Alogobotour entered Croatia to make war, and there they were all slain by the Croats.\n",

      "But when two brothers succeeded their father in the rule of Serbia, one of them, taking a moiety of the folk, claimed the protection of Heraclius, the emperor of the Romans, and the same emperor Heraclius received him and gave him a place in the province of Thessalonica to settle in, namely Serbia, which from that time has acquired this denomination. 'Serbs' in the tongue of the Romans is the word for 'slaves', whence the colloquial 'serbula' for menial shoes, and 'tzerboulianoi' for those who wear cheap, shoddy footgear. This name the Serbs acquired from their being slaves of the emperor of the Romans. Now, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. But when they had crossed the river Danube, they changed their minds and sent a request to the emperor Heraclius, through the military governor then governing Belgrade, that he would grant them other land to settle in. And since what is now Serbia and Pagania and the so-called country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of the Kanalites were under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and since these countries had been made desolate by the Avars (for they had expelle\n",
